# LCWS2021

This is not supposed to replace the
[LCWS repository](https://github.com/LLR-ILD/LCWS2021).
The MC1/MC2 random split procedure changed,
so small differences are to be expected.
Fill this example to:

- Have a place to look at when wondering what plotting utility is
  still missing.
- Have some plots that are comparable for a code cross check.

Most likely, we will simply delete this folder soon.
